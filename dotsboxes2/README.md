# cellsurround
a Dots and Boxes game in JavaScript

To play, go to:
http://pconstrictor.github.io/cellsurround/

This is the classic game where 2 (or more) players take turns connecting the dots. If the new line completely surrounds a cell, 
that cell gets permanently marked for the current player, who then gets another turn.

This square grid's dimensions are fully adjustable, as are the number of players.

So far, it's just focused on functionality--not looks!
