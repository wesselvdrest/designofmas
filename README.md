# Simulating Evolutionary Game Theory in a N-Player Population

_For this study we used the game Dots-and-Boxes_

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Update to Java Version 8 Update 221 (Using JDK 11 and 13 also works)
- A program like that runs Java files, like Eclipse

```
[Download latest version of Java here](https://www.java.com/en/download/) |
[Download latest version of Eclipse here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Installing

A step by step overview of how to get the development environment running.

The first step is to clone the file “Our Project”

```
git clone https://github.com/wesselvdrest/group_B11_designofmas.git
```

Load the code into your Java IDE of choice. For example, in Eclipse 2019-09, go to "File" -> "Open projects from file system" and then select the Folder `Our-project/Our-project` which contains the (hidden) file `.project`.

```
Run
```

You know you can succesfully run the program in its current stage if you can select different playing strategies from 2 players. Then, let the games begin!

## Acknowledgments

*Original code from https://github.com/gaurav708/dots-and-boxes, this code provides the basic Dots and Boxes game, with structures like the board and turn taking conventions.Strategies of agents and the tournament setup are implemented by our own team. Only the SolverHeuristics is copied from the original code (file GreedySolver.java), since it was an interesting strategy to add to our own strategies
