# Simulating Evolutionary Game Theory in a N-Player Population

_For this study we used the game Dots-and-Boxes_

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Update to Java Version 8 Update 221 (Using JDK 11 and 13 also works)
- A program like that runs Java files, like Eclipse

```
[Download latest version of Java here](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
[Download latest version of Eclipse here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Installing

A step by step overview of how to get the development environment running.

The first step is to clone the file “Our Project”

```
git clone FILL IN HERE
```

Load the code into your Java IDE of choice. For example, in Eclipse 2019-09, go to "File" -> "Open projects from file system" and then select the Folder `Our-project/Our-project` which contains the (hidden) file `.project`.

```
Run
```

You know you can succesfully run the program in its current stage if you can select different playing strategies from 2 players. Then, let the games begin!
