## Getting Started

```
- (Download the latest version of Java)[https://www.java.com/en/download/]
- A program like that runs Java files, (like Eclipse) [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]

```

### Installing

A step by step overview of how to get the development environment running.

The first step is to clone the file “Our Project”
